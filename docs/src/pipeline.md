# Data Pipeline

Each node in the following diagram represents the analysis code in the pipeline and the
corresponding table in the database.  Within the pipeline, Element MoSeq
connects to upstream Elements including Lab, Animal, Session, and Event. For more 
detailed documentation on each table, see the API docs for the respective schemas.

The Element is composed of two main schemas, `moseq_train` and `moseq_infer`. The `moseq_train` schema is designed to handle the analysis and ingestion of PCA model for formatted keypoint tracking and train the Kepoint-MoSeq model. The `moseq_infer` schema is designed to handle the analysis and ingestion of Keypoint-MoSeq's motion sequencing on video recordings by using one registered model.

## Table Descriptions

### `lab` schema

- For further details see the [lab schema API docs](https://docs.datajoint.com/elements/element-lab/latest/api/element_lab/lab/)

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Device | Scanner metadata |

### `subject` schema

- Although not required, most choose to connect the `Session` table to a `Subject` table.

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Subject | Basic information of the research subject |

### `session` schema

- For further details see the [session schema API docs](https://docs.datajoint.com/elements/element-session/latest/api/element_session/session_with_datetime/)

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Session | Unique experimental session identifier |

### `moseq_train` schema

| PreFitTask | Specify parameters for model (AR-HMM) pre-fitting. |
| PreFit | Fit AR-HMM model. |
| FullFitTask | Specify parameters for the model full-fitting. |
| FullFit | Fit the full (Keypoint-SLDS) model. |

### `moseq_infer` schema
